class BasinData:
    """
    BasinData is a class that represents data related to a basin.
     It initializes the instance variables by cutting and merging the model
      waterway probability and elevation data for the basin.
       It also performs various operations on the data to generate grids and components related to the basin.

    Methods:
    - __init__(self, basin_geometry: shapely.Polygon, stream_geometry: shapely.LineString,
     paths: BasinPaths, bbox_buffer: float=0.005, **kwargs):
        Initializes the BasinData instance with the given parameters and performs the necessary data operations.
    - cut_basin_data(self, stream_buffer=.0001, **kwargs) -> (xr.DataArray, xr.DataArray, np.ndarray, np.ndarray):
        Cuts and merges the model waterway probability and elevation data for the basin,
         and returns the resulting arrays.
    - make_rounded_grid(self, round_value=.5, **kwargs) -> np.ndarray:
        Creates a rounded version of the probability grid based on the given round_value threshold.
    - probability_grid(self) -> np.ndarray:
        Treated as an instance variable. Creates a numpy array copy of the basin_probability xarray.DataArray and sets
         the tdx-waterways to have a probability of 1 based on the burned waterway raster.
    - connected_grid(self) -> np.ndarray:
        Treated as an instance variable. Creates a copy of the rounded_grid,
         which will be the mutable grid used to connect the disconnected waterways.
    - find_main_component(self) -> int:
        Finds the main component of the tdx-waterways and sets all tdx-waterways to have the same component.
    - find_component_min_elevation_points(self) -> Set[(int, int)]:
        Finds the minimum elevation points for each component and returns them as a set of (row, col) tuples.
    - remove_waterways_out_of_basin(self):
        Removes waterways that are outside of the basin based on the component grid and basin grid.
    - make_weight_grid(self, min_val: float = .1, max_val: float = .5, **kwargs):
        rescales the probability grid using the min_val and max_val inputs,
         then applies -np.log2 to the positive values.

    Instance Variables:
    - bbox_buffer: Buffer distance for the bounding box of the basin.
    - paths: Object that contains the paths for the basin data.
    - basin_geometry: shapely.Polygon representing the geometry of the basin.
    - stream_geometry: shapely.LineString representing the geometry of the stream.
    - grid_bbox: Bounding box of the basin geometry with buffer.
    - basin_probability: xarray.DataArray representing the basin probability.
    - basin_elevation: xarray.DataArray representing the basin elevation.
    - basin_grid: numpy.ndarray representing the basin geometry grid.
    - waterway_grid: numpy.ndarray representing the waterway grid.
    - elevation_grid: numpy.ndarray representing the elevation grid.
    - probability_grid: numpy.ndarray representing the probability grid.
    - rounded_grid: numpy.ndarray representing the rounded probability grid.
    - component_grid: numpy.ndarray representing the component grid.
    - main_component: Integer value representing the main component of the tdx-waterways.
    - weight_grid: The cells are given a weight based on how strongly the model thinks they are water.
    - min_value: The minimum acceptable waterway value for the cell to be considered as a node in the connection process
